# Reproducibility: who cares?

## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author LaCour

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months ago.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly 
discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

## Divorce study felled by a coding error gets a second chance

- **Original conclusion:** The risk of divorce in a heterosexual marriage increases when the wife falls ill, but not the husband. 

- **Corrected conclusion:** Based on the corrected analysis, we conclude that there are not gender differences in the relationship between gender, pooled illness onset, and divorce.

## Divorce study retraction: Editor's note

- "The research environment is fast-paced given the ethos to “publish or perish"."

- "[...] research is becoming increasingly complex, with greater calls for transdisciplinary collaborations, “big data,” and more sophisticated research questions and methods [...] data sets often have multiple files that require merging, change the wording of questions over time, provide incomplete codebooks, and have unclear and sometimes duplicative variables."

- "Given these issues, I would not be surprised if coding errors were fairly common [...]"

# Reproducibility: why should you care?

## Think back to every time...

>- The results in Table 1 don't seem to correspond to those in Figure 2.
>- In what order do I run these scripts?
>- Where did we get this data file?
>- Why did I omit those samples?
>- How did I make that figure?
>- "Your script is now giving an error."
>- "The attached is similar to the code we used."

# Reproducibility: how?

## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how 
were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Ambitious goal + many other concerns 

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable

- reproducibility is built in
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal


## Toolkit

![toolkit](img/toolkit.png)
</center>


## Outline

1. Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

2. Literate programming $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

3. Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub


# 1. Scriptability

## Point-and-click vs. scripting

- Learning curve: Point-and-click software (supposedly) have shallower learning curves than scripting languages

- Documentation: At a minimum, your code documents your analysis
    + And you can do better with comments and README files

- Automation: Need to rerun your analysis with new/updated data? Just change the input file.

- Collaboration: Sharing your analysis is as easy as sharing your scripts

## Why R?

<div class="columns-2">
- Programming language for data analysis
- Free!
- Open source
- Widely used and supported across all disciplines
- Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux

![RSplashScreen](img/RSplash.png)
</div>


## Why not language X?

- There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be 
used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis

- The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate and 
document your analysis

- Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another


## Once in R

<div class="columns-2">
You could just type into the command prompt...

- ... but that doesn't help much with documentation

- ... but that doesn't help much with automation

## 2. Literate programming

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we 
want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming [...] strives for a program that 
is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order 
that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and 
informal methods that reinforce each other."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- but they have never been as accessible as the current tools


## A better solution than just R

With RStudio you can combine your programming and your documentation

<div class="columns-2">
- Gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your
analysis
- Runs on top of R


![RSplashScreen](img/RStudioSplash.png)

## What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (or XHTML) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why I love Markdown:
    + Simple syntax means easy to learn and use.
    + Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging 
    **errors**.
    + Allows for easy web authoring.
    + Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy and add HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS.

## What is R Markdown?

Well, it's R + Markdown

- Ease of Markdown syntax

- Rendering of R code to produce output and plots

## R Markdown: syntax

## Example: Big Five Personality Test

```{r}
big5 <- read.delim("raw-data/big5.txt") %>%
  tbl_df() # for formatting
```

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<font size="3">Source: http://personality-testing.info/_rawdata/</font>

## View data {.smaller}
```{r}
big5
```

## Clean data

You can include script files in your R Markdown document

```{r message=FALSE}
source("code/01-data-cleanup.R")
```

<img src="img/script.png" alt="script" style="width:600px">

## View distribution of age {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(big5, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
summary(big5$age)
```

## Regress extraversion vs. neuroticism and gender {.smaller}

**Extraversion:** Seeking fulfillment from sources outside the self or in community. High scorers are social, low scorers prefer to work alone. **Neuroticism:** Being emotional.

```{r message=FALSE}
m_ext_age <- lm(extraversion ~ neuroticism * gender, data = big5)
summary(m_ext_age)
```

## Plot extraversion vs. age and gender {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = big5, aes(x = neuroticism, y = extraversion, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Suppose you want only teens {.smaller}

```{r}
big5_teen <- filter(big5, age <= 19)
```

```{r}
m_ext_age_teen <- lm(extraversion ~ age * gender, data = big5_teen)
summary(m_ext_age_teen)
```

## Plot for only teens {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = big5_teen, aes(x = neuroticism, y = extraversion, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# 3. Version control

## What is version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Better - Saving everything together at once

Everytime you make a save, you zip the entire directory that your project files are in and save it with a date.


## Best - Version Control

## How does a version control system work? {.smaller}

- Start with a base version of the document, save just the changes you made at each step of the way.

- Think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

<center>
<img src="img/play-changes.png" width="400px" />
</center>

- "Playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.

## Git/GitHub

- Easy to set up
- Integrated with RStudio
- GitHub's strong community: your colleagues are probably already there
- Provides tools to help enhance collaboration
- A common location to share your work

# Parting remarks

## Two-pronged approach

Everyone struggles with reproducibility and it is a hindrance to moving 
science forward.

<div class="columns-2">
\#1 
Adopt a reproducible research workflow

<br><br>

\#2
Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow
